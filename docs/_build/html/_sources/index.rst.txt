DigicamCommissioning's documentation!
=====================================

DigicamCommissioning software is used to analyse data of the DigiCam to perform
calibration and commissioning tasks

==============================
Installation and prerequisites
==============================

`ctapipe <https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe>`_, `CTS <https://github.com/cocov/CTS>`_
and CamerasToACTL should be installed. The best is to install them all in the anaconda environement
generated by the ctapipe installation.

You will also need the following packages ... that can be installed through ``pip``

You can get DigicamCommissioning from https://github.com/cta-observatory/DigiCamCommissioning

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/cta-observatory/DigiCamCommissioning.git


==================
How to use it
==================

To run an analysis script, find or create a configuration file (usually in options/protocols)
and run

.. code-block:: sh

    python script_analysis.py -c -a -d -y options/my_config_file.yaml

the option ``-c`` runs the high level data creation step, ``-a`` runs the analysis, ``-d`` runs
the display part, while ``-y`` allows to specify the yaml configuration file.

To run a plotting script, find or create a configuration file (usually in options/render)
and run

.. code-block:: sh

    python script_render.py -y options/my_config_file.yaml

``-y`` allows to specify the yaml configuration file.
