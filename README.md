# DigiCamCommissioning
A repository allowing to perform the various SST1M 
DigiCam commissionning tasks.
It is build on the `ctapipe` pipeline

## Structure of the repository

In the base folder one can find the high level 
scripts which allow for example to evaluate the
 gain from low light data or which allow to 
 evaluate LED calibration, etc... as well as a set
  of modules holding the low level functionnalities 

The module `data_treatement` contains algorithms 
to various type of histograms out of the data.

The module `spectra_fit` contains high level fits 
definitions.

The module `utils` contains low level functionnalities
such as histogram class, peak finder, plotting helpers,
etc...
